# Developer Pizza

Is a website where employers looking for developers.
First, employers choose from one of our many developer templates:
Java Full-Stack Software Developer, Test Automation Engineer, Salesforce Developer, etc.
Secondly, an employer customizes the template with additional qualifications; maybe you 
want your Full-Stack Software Developer with a side of Rust (for the functionally inclined)
or a slice of Selenium. Finally, the employer submits the developer order to be fulfilled by
Developer Pizza.
