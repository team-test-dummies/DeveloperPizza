# Developer Pizza

Is a website where employers looking for developers, and developers looking for work, 
can find each other. Both parties have their own unique accounts with information the other
party will find pertinent. Developer accounts must include name, address, and email.
Employer accounts must include a name, address, contact, and email. The contact field 
is the full name developers should use when addressing the employers hiring staff. For a
small company, this may be the name of a single employee handling the email; for large
companies the contact field is usually the full name of their hiring department.

## Creating Jobs

Employers can open jobs using the create job form on their homepage. After creating a job,
that job is searchable by every developer on the Developer Pizza website. If an employer should
wish to modify a job description (or close the job because they found their dream developer), an
employer can do so on the 'manage jobs' page.

Developer pizza is a career networking index and not a social media platform. After either
party has found a candidate that they are interested in interviewing with (or for!), that party
must send their candidate a good ol' fashioned email to express their interest.
To that end, Developer Pizza includes several searching features
