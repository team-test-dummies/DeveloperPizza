# Developer Pizza

It is a place where employers can find developers that are looking for a job.
There is a login portal for each account type. Employers get to filter developers
based on languages, tools, and skills (maybe hobbies). 

## Login

We need two logins: one for developers looking for a job;
one for employers looking for developers.
