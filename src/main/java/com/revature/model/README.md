# API Models

> Model classes 'serialize' the data that
will  be received from the endpoints and
the database. They are a representation of
a record.

For Project 2, we created a model for both a *user* and *order*. A *user model* allows a way to define the
attributes needed for accounts, and an *order model* will allow a way to define the order attributes.
